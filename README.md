# Rails URL Helpers

Rails is meant to be flexible. As a result, there are typically a
number of ways to accomplish the same goals. Routes are a great example of how
this principle operates in a Rails app. In this section, we will review how to
leverage built-in URL helper methods instead of hard coding route paths into an
application (along with why this is a good idea).

## Paths vs Route Helpers

What's a real-world difference between using hard-coded paths compared with
route helper methods? Let's imagine that you have a meeting in NYC, and you
want to get from one side of the city to the other. You have a couple of
different options:

1. Traverse the streets on foot
2. Take a taxi

Walking is like hard coding your route's path. Technically, it can work.
However, it's slow, potentially error-prone (one small mistake can lead to the
wrong part of town), and, if the meeting location changes, it will require
quite a bit of manual work to adjust and walk to the new destination.

Taking a taxi is like using a route helper: you can simply provide the address
to the driver and let them navigate the city streets for you. It is faster than
walking, and, if the address for the meeting changes while you're en route,
it's not as difficult or slow to adjust.

Don't worry if it's still a little fuzzy. Here's an example of what it looks
like in code:

* **Hard-coded path:** `"/posts/#{@post.id}"`

Here you're saying: "I know exactly the GPS coordinates of my meeting, driver.
Do exactly as I say."

* **Route helper:** `post_path(@post)`

Here you're saying: "Can you find the best way to a controller that knows how
to work with this thing called a `Post` based on looking at this instance
called `@post`.

We want to use route helper methods as opposed to hard coding because:

* Route helpers are more dynamic since they are methods and not simply strings.
  This means that if something changes with the route there are many cases
  where the code itself won't need to be changed at all

* Route helper methods help clean up the view and controller code and assist
  with readability. *On a side note, you cannot use these helper methods in
  your model files*

* It's more natural to be able to pass arguments into a method as opposed to
  using string interpolation. For example, `post_path(post, opt_in: true)` is
  more readable than `"posts/<%= post.id %>?opt_in=true"`

* Route helpers translate directly into HTML-friendly paths. In other words, if
  you have any weird characters in your URLs, the route helpers will convert
  them so they can be read properly by browsers. This includes spaces and 
  characters such as `&`, `%`, etc.


## Implementing Route Helpers

To begin, we're going to start with an application that has the MVC set up for
`posts`, with `index` and `show` actions currently in place. The route call
looks like this:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
```

This will create routing methods for posts that we can utilize in our views and
controllers. Running `rails routes` in the terminal will give the following
output:

```bash
posts   GET  /posts(.:format)       posts#index
post    GET  /posts/:id(.:format)   posts#show
```

These four columns tell us everything that we'll need to use the route helper
methods. The breakdown is below:

* **Column 1** - This column gives the prefix for the route helper methods. In
  the current application, `posts` and `post` are the prefixes for the methods
  that you can use throughout your applications. The two most popular method
  types are `_path` and `_url`. So if we want to render a link to
  our posts' index page, the method would be `posts_path` or `posts_url`. The
  difference between `_path` and `_url` is that `_path` gives the relative path
  and `_url` renders the full URL. If you open up the rails console, by running
  `rails console`, you can test these route helpers out. Run `app.posts_path` and
  see what the output is. You can also run `app.posts_url` and see how it prints
  out the full path instead of the relative path. **In general, it's best to use
  the `_path` version so that nothing breaks if your server domain changes**

* **Column 2** - This is the HTTP verb

* **Column 3** - This column shows what the path for the route will be and what
  parameters need to be passed to the route. As you may notice, the second row
  for the show route calls for an ID. When you pass the `:show` argument to the
  `resources` method, it will automatically create this route and assume that you
  will need to pass the `id` into the URL string. Whenever you have `id`
  parameters listed in the path like this, you will need to pass the route helper
  method an ID, so an example of what our show route code would look like is
  `post_path(@post)`. Notice how this is different than the `index` route of
  `posts_path`. Also, you can ignore the `(.:format)` text for now. If you open
  up the Rails console again, you can call the route helpers. If you have a
  `Post` with an `id` of `3`, you can run `app.post_path(3)` and see what the
  resulting output is. Running route helpers in the rails console is a great way
  of testing out routes to see what their exact output will be

* **Column 4** - This column shows the controller and action with a syntax of
  `controller#action`

One of the other nice things about utilizing route helper methods is that they
create predictable names for the methods. Once you get into day-to-day Rails
development, you will only need to run `rails routes` to find custom paths.

Let's imagine that you take over a legacy Rails application that was built with
traditional routing conventions. If you see CRUD controllers for newsletters,
students, sales, offers, and coupons, you don't have to look up the routes to
know that you could call the index URLs for each resource below:

* Newsletters - `newsletters_path`
* Students - `students_path`
* Sales - `sales_path`
* Offers - `offers_path`
* Coupons - `coupons_path`

This is an example of the Rails design goal: "convention over configuration."
Rails' convention is that resources are accessible through their pluralized
name with `_path` tacked on. Since **all** Rails developers honor these
conventions, Rails developers rapidly come to feel at home in other Rails
developers' codebases.


## The `link_to` Method

Our first three tests are currently passing; let's take a look at the lone
failure. The failing test ensures that a link from the index page will point to
that post's respective show page view template:

```ruby
describe 'index page' do
  it 'links to post page' do
    second_post = Post.create(title: "My Title", description: "My post description")
    visit posts_path
    expect(page).to have_link(second_post.title, href: post_path(second_post))
  end
end
```

This matcher is currently failing since our index page doesn't link to the show
page. To fix this, let's update the index page like so:

```erb
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><a href='<%= "/posts/#{post.id}" %>'><%= post.title %></a></div>
<% end %>
```

That is some bossy code. Let's use a `link_to` method to clean this up and get
rid of multiple `ERB` calls on the same line.

```erb
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><%= link_to post.title, "/posts/#{post.id}" %></div>
<% end %>
```

This works and gets the tests passing, however, it can be refactored. Instead of
hard-coding the path and using string interpolation, let's use `post_path` and
pass in the `post` argument.

```erb
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><%= link_to post.title, post_path(post.id) %></div>
<% end %>
```

This is much better, but to be thorough, let's make one last refactor: Rails is
smart enough to know that if you pass in the `post` object as an argument, it
should use the ID attribute, so we'll use this implementation code:

```erb
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %></div>
<% end %>
```

If you run the tests now, you'll see that they're all still passing.

We're using the `link_to` method to automatically create an HTML `a` tag. If
you open the browser and inspect the HTML element of the link, you would see
the following:

![Link To](https://s3.amazonaws.com/flatiron-bucket/readme-lessons/link_to.png)

(If your browser loads a blank page, add Post.create(title: 'A lovely title',
description: 'A superb description') to `db/seeds.rb`, run rake `db:seed`, and
then restart your server.) As you can see, even though we never added HTML code
for the link –– e.g., `<a href="..."></a>` –– the `link_to` method rendered the
correct tag for us.)


## Using the :as option

If for any reason you don't like the naming structure for the methods or paths,
you can customize them quite easily. A common change is to customize the path users
go to in order to register for a site.

If we had a `User` model/controller, in `routes.rb` file, you would add the
following line:

```ruby
get '/users/new', to: 'users#new', as: 'register'
```

Now the application lets programmers use `register_path` when creating links
with `link_to`. Rails leverages routes and these "helper route" names in many
places to help you keep your code flexible and brief.

## Summary

Hopefully, this lesson shed some light on the beauty of using route helper
methods. If you run the tests again after making the above changes, you'll
notice something interesting: all of the tests are still passing! If we had
hardcoded the URLs in the links in our views, we would have had a major issue:
all of our links to the show pages would have broken, along with our Capybara
tests. However, by using the built-in helper methods, the links all updated
automatically.
